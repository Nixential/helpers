# Helpers Package

The `helpers` package is a collection of generic utility functions in Go, designed to perform common operations on slices. It includes functions for iterating, transforming, and filtering slices.

## Features

- `ForEach`: Iterates over each element in a slice.
- `Map`: Transforms each element in a slice.
- `Filter`: Filters elements in a slice based on a condition.

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher.

## Installation

Import the package in your Go file:

```go
import "path/to/helpers"
```

Replace `path/to/helpers` with the actual path of the package.

## Usage

### ForEach

Performs an operation for each element in a slice.

```go
helpers.ForEach(slice, func(index int, value T) {
    // Your code here
})
```

### Map

Transforms a slice by applying a function to each of its elements.

```go
newSlice := helpers.Map(slice, func(element T, index int, s []T) T {
    // Transformation logic
    return newValue
})
```

### Filter

Filters a slice, keeping only elements that satisfy a given condition.

```go
filteredSlice := helpers.Filter(slice, func(element T) bool {
    // Condition logic
    return condition
})
```
